16,Marvel,Dr. Doom,"There‚Äôs a theory that most people have probably heard of already. To summarize, it says that Janet Vandyne is actually Dr. Doom. 
So, I think I‚Äôve found more evidence towards this. 

I just rewatched Antman and the Wasp. When Janet takes control of Scott to rearrange a problem with the machine, she says ‚ÄúI thought about this for 30 years.‚Äù  This is not true, because she was only in the quantum realm for 30 hours. Because of Endgame, we know that one hour in the quantum realm is equal to one year in real time. So why is she lying for no reason? It took Hank MUCH longer to plan this out. How did she know there was a problem with that one part of the machine? 30 years in the realm and she doesn‚Äôt even mention how time works differently there. 
Then my second piece of evidence is the fact that she aged. When Scott came back from the quantum realm, he didn‚Äôt look like he aged one bit. Even though an entire 5 years had passed, he didn‚Äôt age. We know this for sure because Scott‚Äôs beard would have grown out when he came back. But, he was the same. So why did Janet age? Was she not in the quantum realm? Something is odd. 

Something else that isn‚Äôt related to this. 
When Hank received that phone call in Endgame, they say the mail guys opened the box and it‚Äôs glowing. What if the mail guys were actually the fantastic four? They opened the box and got transported to the quantum realm. 
Ghost received her powers from the quantum realm, Janet got her powers from there, so it doesn‚Äôt seem that far fetched for the fantastic four to get their powers from there.",0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,movies,2021-11-28 12:42:02,r3x1ba,t3

18,Marvel,Reading Al Ewing's Ultimates collection. The tie-in to Civil War II really did majorly affect the first series.,"The book was absolutely derailed by the event. Like the first half is great its own contained story but the 2nd half is absolutely butchered to the connection to Civil War II as too much stuff is happening *outside* the book. To the point that what destroys the Ultimates doesn't even happens within the series and is only covered in an epilogue issue. Too much focus is spent on doing Earth stuff and on nothing of the cosmic stuff the first half of the book set-up.

And of course Carol is the absolute worst here. Its no exaggeration just how much this event ruins her as a character and how it bleeds into all her appearances.  The  worst part is that due to Marvel not wanting Carol to be recognized as the villain she is acting here, the reactions of the other Ultimates don't go far enough in criticizing her. Blue Marvel and America Chavez spend the entire arc stating their extreme displeasure at Carol's actions to the point America hits Carol with a chair but in the final issue they talk to her as if all problems are completely resolved with hugs all around with even America hugging and talking to her with all their problems and disputes just resolved.

While Carol has the gall to call T'Challa ""*the man who murdered the Ultimates*"". Again Carol is just the worst here and even Ewing with all his writing ability just can't make this work. Its not an exaggeration just how much of a disaster Civil War II is here. Its astounding how this utterly damages Carol as a character and its even worse than what the original Civil War did to Tony because at least there characters were allowed to call out Tony on what an absolute jerkwad he is.

Here though because of Marvel's obvious favoritism with the character there's no moments akin to Thor calling Tony just a tin man in flimsy armor and humiliating him.",0.83,4.0,0.0,4.0,comics,2021-11-28 12:22:21,r3wpg3,t3

20,Marvel,"What If..? Loki, The Prince of Ragnar√∂k","*Time. Space. Reality. It's more than a linear path. It's a prism of endless possibility, where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities, creating alternate worlds from the ones you know. I am the Watcher. I am your guide through these vast new realities. Follow me and ponder the question... ""What if?""*

""The only matter I do not take seriously, Boy; is you. Your politics bore me and your demeanor is that of a pouty child. I shall honor our agreement, Asgardian. If you bring me the artifacts. Return to me again as a failure and i shall bath the starways in your blood. Now Kneel, and get the job done.""

Thanos commanded of Loki. It was this moment that differed from the universe you know. In your universe, this meeting took place with Ronan the Accuser; in this Universe - Loki stood in his place, tasked with gathering mythical artifacts in exchange for planetary rule.

But in this moment of internal conflict, Loki's magic adapted to the power of the Scepter he was holding. The Mind Stone. Enhanced with the knowledge of the Infinity Stones - Loki's reign over this universe began in this moment.

""Kneel"" Loki spits back. Nebula looked on in shock as she's never heard someone command something of her father, Thanos.

Thanos stands from his throne, Stepping down towards Loki; Thanos grabs Loki by the throat and begins to choke the life from him.

""You.. will... never.. be.. a god"" Loki's last words as the Mad Titan choked the life from him.

His lifeless body in Thanos' hand - Loki initiated his plan. A mirage, a spell Thanos did not know Loki capable of, Until Thanos was under control of the Sceptre.

""I said, KNELL!"" Loki commanded of his subject.

Nebula bowed to a knee as she watched her father accept Loki's leadership without hesitation.

Loki knew that trust was a child's emotion. Enslaving Nebula and The Black Order to the power of the stone.

The God of Mischief now had the Mad Titan and his army under his command. With the Mind Stone in hand, Loki gathered his forces to prepare for the invasion of Asgard. His First destination; Knowhere

His first objective; Reunite the Sceptre with the Aether and the Orb

**What If..? Loki, Prince of Ragnar√∂k. Part 2.**

*With the Mad Titan under his control using the powers of the Mind Stone, Loki arrived to Knowhere. Intellectually advanced from the infinity stone in hand; Loki's planning was successful before he even initiated action. With the Aether already in the Collector's collection, Loki waited for the Orb to be brought to him*. *I am the Watcher. I am your guide through these vast new realities. Follow me and ponder the question... ""What if?""*

""Infinity Stones. These stones it seems can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary purpose.""

*Purpose. The phase uttered by the Collector differed from the universe you know. In your universe, the collector quoted strength. His slave grabbing the Power Stone causing destruction amongst the collection. But in this universe... This wasn't the Collector.*

""Of which, I am the greatest.""

Before anyone could react to the cryptic words of the Collector; The blade of the Mad Titan swung fierce.

""Woah!"" Rocket exclaimed as he and Groot took cover.

""I Am Groot""

""Yeah I see his head was just chopped off! I doubt we're going to get any credits from this exchange. Let's get out of here!""

Peter Quill, the Ravager known as Star Lord. No longer the Guardian this galaxy needs.

Gamora, Daughter of Thanos, draws her blade quickly and lunges towards her father. As the tip of The GodSlayer reaches the Titan's throat; it comes to a halt.

Darkness envelopes Gamora's eyes as Loki takes hold of her mind.

His plan complete without a hitch. Loki was now in possession of three Infinity Stones.

""Vormir""

Loki grins, as he sets off on the next part of his journey.

**What If..?** **Loki, Prince of Ragnar√∂k. Part 3**

*Loki arrived on Vormir, walking in step with his adopted brother Thor. Enchanted armor appears over Loki, his helmet glistening with the infinity stones it holds. Loki approaches the guardian of the stone; who explains the cost of obtaining the power of the soul stone. I am the Watcher. I am your guide through these vast new realities. Follow me and ponder the question... ""What if?""*

**""You must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.""** Red Skull hauntingly whispers.

""Brother."" Loki looks at Thor

""You know I've always been destined for greatness. I was the rightful ruler of Earth and you denied me this purpose. Cast me aside from Asgard. I will rule them all.""

""Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were going to fight side by side forever. But at the end of the day you're you and I'm me. Maybe there is still good in you. But let's be honest. Our paths diverged a long time ago.""

""Yeah. It's probably for the best that we never see each other again""

""That's what you've always wanted""

The exchange complete.

The final words of Thor Odinson.

*Loki was now in possession of the most powerful infinity stone. As he adds the ingot to his helmet, The glow of the reality stone ceases.*

Mischievous. The trickster god managed to defy reality and obtain the soul's power at the cost of a false exchange.

With the soul connected to the other stones; Loki set on his path towards the remaining artifacts. The eye of Agamotto and The Tessaract

27,Marvel,Venom in the MCU.,"So, with Venom teleporting into the MCU, there's now incredible potential for storylines.

However, one of the challenges is putting Eddie Brock at odds with Peter Parker. It's now been established that the alien symbiotes possess memories from other universes, so Venom remembers Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man destroying him. This version of Eddie Brock, however, doesn't seem to have any vitriol towards Spider-Man.

I could see them setting up a sort of ""Civil War"" scenareo after _No Way Home_. Whatever villains are left standing after the latest film will allign with two factions of heroes. The reason would obviously be plot-related. This would be the MCU's version of ""Secret Wars"". Venom would bond with Spider-Man for a time, and when he rebonds with Eddie, he'll get the classic white spider symbol on his torso.

49,Marvel,What If..? The First Avenger was The Last,"Time. Space. Reality. It's more than a linear path. It's a prism of endless possibility, where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities, creating alternate worlds from the ones you know. I am the Watcher. I am your guide through these vast new realities. Follow me and ponder the question... ""What if?""

Iron Man: ""I said we'd lose. You said we'd do that together too. Well guess what Cap, We lost; and you weren't there. ~..

Here. You take this. You find him, and you hide.""

Having been given Iron Man's suit and unsure of Tony's willingness to continue to participate in the battle Steve knew was coming; This was the very first moment Captain America wore one of Iron Man's suits.

The leader, an expert combatant now protected and enhanced by the power of Iron Man.

This universe did not differ much from the one that you know. The Hulk tried his attempt at time travel and failed, Turing Scott Lang into a baby.. among other things.

With the help of the Hulk who was now merged with Bruce Banner, Captain America was able to modify the suit Tony gave him to be equipped with the Captain America shield. - If Tony allowed it's use.

Iron man arrived to The Avengers compound having cracked time travel and with Captain America's shield in hand.

The Avengers pulled off their Time heist and gathered the stones... But as you know from your universe this was not all they got from this journey..

The death of Black Widow weighed heavily on The Avengers, but their mission stood. It must be completed.

...

With the time heist completed and the stones assembled, Hulk prepared to snap his fingers; And Thanos attacked.

Thanos rained fire from his ship upon the compound. Causing unfathomable damage, and death.

Hawkeye, Ant-man, Rocket, War Machine, &amp; The Hulk.

The Merge with Banner &amp; the power of the Nano-Gauntlet weakened The Hulk. The explosions and collapse of the compound atop of these hero's we're fatal to them all.

""Come on Buddy, Wake up. That's my man, You lose this again I'm keeping it. You mess with time; it tends to mess back""

These were the final words spoken by Iron man to Captain America before his death.

Thor called upon the Odin Force. Dual wielding mjolnir and stormbreaker the trio stepped up to Thanos for the fight of their lives.

Thanos was too much for our mighty hero's.

The death of Iron man stunned The Avengers. Thor's hammer crushed into the Iron Man's chest, AI Friday pleading for her boss to wake up, he never did.

Thor - distracted by his actions resulting in the death of a Ally and friend, Thanos gained the upper hand. Being beaten and close to death Thor recalls stormbreaker. Thanos catches the flying mythic weapon and quickly pressed it deep into the God of Lightings chest.

The sky cried out with cracks of thunder &amp; lightning as the life was drained from Thor. Thanos leaned in to Thor's lifeless body and proclaimed ""That's how you aim for the chest""

Steve Rogers screamed in agonizing pain. Dropping the shield to his side he stared out to the battlefield where the fallen heroes lay.

What he didn't know was that he was about to unlock his greatest potential. The Last Avenger.

Thanos:""You will not be able to live with your failure. This time, You won't be coming back to me. I will shred this universe down to it's last atom. Then with the stones you've collected for me; create a new grateful one born out of blood, And you won't be alive to tell them.""

""ASSEMBLE"" From the depths of his lungs, with everything he had Steve let out this war cry.

That's when the Odin Force exploded around him. Mjolnir and his shield flew to his open hands.

The Last Avenger was born.

(Image: Iron Man Helmet shaped as Thor's Ragnarok helmet, Odin Cape and runed-chest plate combined with End Game iron suit, Mjolnir, Cap's Shield, Star-shaped Reactor)

Empowered by his fallen allies, The battle for Earth was just starting.. With the Last Avenger standing between peace and annihilation.

What If..? The Last Avenger. Part 2

This universe is on the brink of destruction. Thanos is a single conquer away from universal reign. It seems only one stands in his way, and he can do this all day. At this point he goes by many names; Steve Rogers, Captain America, The First Avenger, The Last Avenger. I am the Watcher. I am your guide through these vast new realities. Follow me and ponder the question... ""What if?""

Odin Runes imprint the ground around him as an explosion of lighting arcs down upon Captain America.

Worthy, He knew it. To wield it - it cost him everything.

""We'll do this together."" Steve says to himself, closing his eyes for a brief seconds to calm himself. Lighting bounces between the runes upon the ground, Mjolnir, and his suit of armor. Charged with more power than Tony ever anticipated.

Captain America reaches the god's hammer up to the sky.Summoning a storm of lighting that would make Heimdall squint.

He points Mjolnir towards Thanos, raising his other hand and takes aim at his target.

Charging an Arc Blast from the Reactor and Runes on his chest - The Last Avenger sends a shockwave towards Thanos. Obliterating the surrounding compound around him.

Thanos spins his blade anticipating impact. A trick he's mastered through his years of balancing.

Never has he felt an attack such as this one.

He held for as long as he could, but as he noticed a crack forming in his once thought indestructible blade Thanos trusted in his armor and strength; embraced the shockwave.

Thrown across the field and stripped of his armor, The Mad Titan suffered a massive blow. Much more than a single drop of blood - Thanos grunts as he struggles to reach his feet.

A single command from the Titan and his army began to appear from his floating fortress.

The rubble of the once marvelous compound which was now leveled from the blast, reveals the Nano-Gauntlet behind The Last Avenger. Rogers takes a boxers stance as the Titan's army begins to charge towards him.

He throws his shield high above the rushing soldiers, The Black Order leading the infantry. Sending an arc of lighting and Mjolnir towards the flying shield. Rogers clears a section the horde as his weapons returns.

""Hey Cap"", he hears in his ear piece. A familiar voice.

As his eyes catch an explosion through the center of Thanos' massive warship

What If..? The Last Avenger. Part 3

The Avengers were defeated. Thanos' Army charging towards Earth's Last Hope. A familiar voice, a distant explosion. I am The Watcher. I am your guide through these vast new realities. Follow me and ponder the question... ""What if?""

Captain America begins the toughest battle he's ever fought. Outnumbered but not outgunned, Steve Rogers opens fire with the full force of his Arsenal upon the rushing horde.

As Thanos gets to his feet he looks up upon his life's creation crumbling above him. He has no idea what force has done this but he knows it is not an ally of his.

Captain Marvel crashes to the ground in the middle of Thanos's army. Landing on Cull Obsidian; the largest member she could see.

Danvers shoots a blast of cosmic energy. Ebony Maw takes notice of her, and begins to manipulate the ground around her; throwing boulders of Earth and dead wardog soldiers at Captain Marvel in an attempt to stop her.

As these two Heroes give everything they have to the fight they're in - this universe saw sacrifice that not even Doctor Strange could have predicted.

Nebula, daughter of Thanos and the remaining Black Order members: Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive all set their eyes upon the Nano-gauntlet lying behind the armoured avenger.

""No!"" Steve shouts as he turns so see Nebula picking up the stones.

Moments away from this universe's demise was when it happened.

The familiar voice return.

""Hey Cap, Looks like you could use a little rescuing""

With the iconic clanking of an Iron man suit landing on the ground, energy blades appear through chest of the black order members.

Rescue has arrived, and with it; Earth last hope.

Captain America retracts his helmet. Meeting the gaze of the hero who just arrived; tears swell his eyes.

""Friday told me everything. He knew the chance you had and he stood with you. He believed in you, and he gave us a chance to end this.""

Pepper Potts explained as she pulls the blades from the Order's chests.

""Got something for me?"" She asks as she raises her arm towards Nebula. As her arm reaches her target it transforms into a Reactor-Blaster that beams towards Nebula, piercing her through her robotic heart.

Rescue approaches the Nano-gauntlet.

She reaches down towards it as it begins to shift along with the NanoTech on her suit. The two begin to merge and she hears the man she love's voice echo through her.

""Fourteen million, six hundred and five. Bring back what we lost""

Steve Rogers looks on in fear of what's about to happen. Unable to will himself to stop her, as much as he wishes the sacrifice could be him, earth needs the Avengers.

""Take care of Morgan. She has a heart of Iron, she'll understand. You'll do the right thing Steve, you always do.""

""Peace in our time."" Steve Nods.

With a blue metal suit around his whole world, Pepper Potts raises two fingers of the Nano-gauntlet. Activating the power of the infinity stones, she wishes for exactly this.

I really loved how the ending tied all the episodes together and how the ""Evil"" Dr. Strange is given a role. However I still dont understand something regarding the multiple timelines and universes that exist now based on the Loki show and what we saw on the What if series. Did Loki and Sylvie's destruction of the Ultimate timeline create all these new universes, or do they just exist in one universe that happens to have multiple time lines now?

Also is the What If series technically cannon or no?

While I‚Äôm not about to hold my breath for Marvel to renew X-Men: Evolution or Avengers: Earth‚Äôs Mightiest Heroes, I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll begin to develop more projects separate from the MCU.

I just had this random thought that it was weird that someone would write a Wolverine story in which he flat out refuses to pop his claws until the last act, almost as if it wasn't originally written for him. Then the other details came:

* He has a blind Hawkeye as a sidekick, a role that could have easily been  Cyclops', meaning that someone made a choice of making this more an Avengers Wolverine story than an X-Men Wolverine story;
* He eventually fights Red Skull in a (Bucky) Cap suit and kills him using the shield;
* A really big part of the story is dedicated to Logan and Hawkeye crossing the USA, which would make more sense for a character that is supposed to represent America, while Logan is Canadian.

Now, yeah, the whole thing with killing all of the X-Men and the Hulk clan make more sense for Logan than it would have made for Cap, but these could all have been added after the first draft, especially considering that the Hulks really only matter in the first and last acts of the book.

First I was thinking if he had a handmade web-shooter it would be like a traditional spiderman with special gadgets he can make with this web-shooter fluid. But then I'm thinking if the spider is more genetically modified then I'm thinking of organic webbing like the Sam Rami films but still has small gadgets like one where it makes his organic webbing electric.

But the comic ultron is this, unfeeling, uncaring, creation of hank pym, I love that version, but it's been a long time since I read the origin of ultron and so I cant recall what his motives were. I tried googling it but nothing came up, I know pym created him and he developed a hatred for him and for mankind, but what are his motives and his end game plan. I know it ends in mankind's death or some kind of assimilation, but after that I cant find anything else out.

I love the dynamics between the different characters, which is very interesting to me since its very different from spiderverse since only one peter parker and while the rest have similar histories to peter, they do not hold similar views. 

I would love to see their personalities play off one another, with Kaine, Octavius and 2099 being darker and serious and Miles, Ben and Peter being pals.

Because of so much rewriting in the MCU, Balder can be rewritten as an older son of Odin, perhaps Hel's twin brother, her opposite in nature. To let the current story make sense, Balder could have been opposed to this, and Hel attempted to kill her brother, causing Hel to be locked away but the brother sent off world to heal from his wounds, being stuck in a comma. And within keeping to the prophecy of Ragnarok, Balder returns after the destruction of Asgard.

At first they didn't want to let me because GG is also white but then they agreed because he's a villain. I remember even as Goblin I still
kept trying to save Mary Jane. All I wanted was to be a hero, but I thought it wasn't possible because of my skin color. Fast forward 19 years, and ""Shang-Chi"" changed all of that.

It was so sweet of him and comes straight out of the comics with Clint being her mentor. There wasn't any action in the episode, but that was fine. I guess that's why I thought this ep was a little slow. Also in some parts, this episode was a little silly. I'm Intrigued, so I will keep watching this show, but I'm worried if this show can keep me interested in the long run.  I have seen two episodes so far and I haven't been too wowed yet. And this is the first time this has happened to a marvel Disney+ show. But the one thing I have to appreciate is seeing Kate in action and watching her struggle. Whenever she's fighting someone I like the fact that she thinks she knows what she's doing, but she truly doesn't know how dangerous it is to put herself in these types of situations where she becomes a vigilante. She's a good fighter, but I like seeing that she still needs help and training, which Clint will give her that. I also loved seeing how much of a big fan Kate is of Hawkeye.

I originally got into Marvel by watching the MCU. I had a Marvel Unlimited subscription and read a bunch of comics that I found by using the resources on this sub. 

Since then, I got rid of my Marvel Unlimited subscription, and I found a local comic book shop. The shop is currently holding all new issues of The Death of Dr. Strange, The Trial of Magneto, and the new Hawkeye series that comes out this week for me. 

Is there a place where I can find information about new titles? I know the current X-Men and Avengers stories are ending soon, so I would prefer to find a series (like the new Hawkeye) that I can read from issue #1 onwards.

I loved the Young Avengers origin story I read on MU. I also really liked all the Sam Wilson Captain America stories. Is this community aware of any new stories surrounding these characters? Is there a particular new comic series that this community is excited about?

143,Marvel,The MCU Spidey origin I have been thinking about since Homecoming's first announcement,"Have been sharing this with friends for a while, but felt y'all would appreciate this as fellow Marvel fans:

I have had this idea in my mind for forever (before Homecoming came out) and just never had a context to share but Peter mentioning the spider in the recent trailer reminded me:

End of The Avengers, Shawarma Post Credit scene:

Camera slowly pans away from the avengers, moves ground level over the rubble to the carcass of one of the Chitauri Leviathans (the big alien ship centipede things). There's a mini dramatic pause. And an alien looking spider crawls out.

Fade to black.

Why I think this would have worked:

1. The whole radioactive spider thing didn't work with the MCU as it was at that time: grounded in science and yes a bit of alien stuff but still grounded in some form of wonky science

2. This would have been enough to hint that this is THE spider, especially if they made it a weird glowy alien red and blue.

3. This would still have left an opening for one of the Spidey baddies to find said spider and experiment on it: Doc ock, Norman Osborne, and Peter could have bumped into it by accident a la Tobey and Garfield.

4. But the best part is, they wouldn't have had to. It could have been just that and folks would have known, and it would have been a nice connecting thread (see what I did there?)

Woof glad to share it with you folks. Would love to hear if you would have loved or hated this. Will not be offended!",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,movies,2021-11-24 00:22:06,r0i8gj,t3

So my question is, did Doctor Strange ever actually come back? Or was he replaced, and just remained that way? Cause with this recent Death of Doctor Strange, I'm wondering if the right one is even dying.",0.62,2.0,0.0,2.0,comics,2021-11-23 23:48:41,r0hgkt,t3
145,Marvel,Eternals theory,"Ok, I have the theory that Eternals could introduce the transformers to the MCU. Now hear me out, in the Eternals, they have to stop the emergence, or the earth being blown up so a new celestial breaks out of the ""egg"". Now the Transformers were originally marvel characters, teaming up with the Avengers on many occasions, and then Hasbro bought them. But in transformers, we learn that the earth's core is a giant dormant transformer, Unicron, who when he curled up into a ball, the earth's mass gathered around him. So the emergence could have been trying to wake up Unicron, which would introduce the transformers",0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,movies,2021-11-23 22:38:37,r0fx27,t3
146,Marvel,"Marvel's whole ""Humanity hates mutants"" is kinda doesn't make any sense.","This is relevant to comics but you can see that same story element in any X-Men related content ever created. 

In the Marvel universe most of humanity hates Mutants to the point that they were very much okay with numerous tries of extermination, both on government and street level. 
This hatred is so blind that even after the X-Men different teams saved time and time again humanity from different threats, people still support treating mutants worse than cockroaches.

And it makes 0 sense.

I understand the idea the X-Men books tried to explore - racism. I'm a Jew with family that survived the Holocaust so I feel the themes explored in the comics and other media is super important. But that hatred seems too specific.

In the Marvel universe there are many types of super powered beings - some are gods, others are aliens from space or ancient races that inhabited the Earth along humans since the start. Then there are mutants - people born with a mutant X gene that makes them mutants with powers/altered appearance, and then there are Mutates - regular born people that got powers or mutations by any other mean that birth. 
The super beings ingrained into society of each and every country, there are super teams acting like police forces, galactic defenders, street vigilantes and many more.

And out of all of those - only the mutants hated. A human looking mutant with telekinesis will be hated and spit on, but a human 3 foot lizard hybrid that grew himself another arm is a respected scientist that had a lab accident. It makes no sense. How regular humans make this distinction.

They cheer the avengers, only to go on wide protests when they accept one mutant to their ranks. 


By this point in the comic I'd expect it to stop being such a relevant plot point of the entire franchise. If they weren't sharing a universe with other forms of altered humans that would be less weird.


Anyway that's something that has been on my mind and I didn't really found anyone talking about it, so perhaps there can be some interesting discussion on the topic in this thread.",0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,other,2021-11-23 20:57:20,r0dso5,t3
147,Marvel,All the villains who might duel with Spidey in a film in the future,"**Vulture -** Still active and formed an alliance with Michael Morbius. Revealed by Michael Keaton recently that he's shooting some Vulture scenes.

**Morbius -** Obviously, new. Pretty positive that he'll battle with the web-slinger, especially afterhis alliance with Vulture.

**Venom -** Both are in the same universe now. Andy Serkis and Tom Hardy have expressed their desire to pit them against each other in the future.

**Kraven the Hunter -** The SSU's Kraven movie is in the making, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson starring as Kraven. His spear appears in the end credits of TASM 2. A truck labelled *Kraven National Ballet* and another one labelled *Kraven Pastries* are shown in the leaked set photos of Morbius.

**Shocker -** The second Shocker is still alive and out there.

**Rhino -** Teased in the Morbius trailer. Has an unfinished duel with Andrew Garfield's spidey.

**Black Cat -** Also teased in the Morbius trailer. Not having her fight Pete will be like introducing Catwoman and not letting her meet Batman.

**Mysterio -** A bit of a stretch, but who knows?

**Goblin Junior and Meth Goblin -** With another Spider-man trilogy in the making, these guys can make cameos, at the very least.

**TASM's Doc Ock and Vulture -** Yes, I know the chances are like one in 10 trillion, but I like to dream.

**The Hobgoblin -** This is a stretchy rumor, but what if Ned dies and comes back with Goblin tech? I mean, we saw a Hobgoblin helmet in Spider-man 3 in Harry's lair.",0.6,1.0,0.0,1.0,other,2021-11-23 22:21:26,r0fjki,t3

I honest need someone to break this down for me like I am a 5 year old cause I can not wrap my head around this. 

There were multiple Batman/Superman references in the Eternals‚Ä¶the biggest being when Ikaris and Sersi go to Phastos and his kid says something along the following:

Son: is he superman? (About Ikaris)

PHastos: No he isn‚Äôt

Son: But he was just in London! I saw him on the news


So are you telling me that when our sweet baby lord and savior, Loki, got mind fucked by Thanos in avengers one that on the other side of NY (or Gotham) that Batman and Superman were jerking each other off cause they both have mothers named ‚ÄúMartha‚Äù!?

But every klyntar we see, including ones that aren‚Äôt descendants of venom, look like monster spider-men. All except a few, like Anti-Venom‚Äôs imp eyes, who still has the carnage war paint in the shape of the spider-man eyes, and the twisted spider emblem, and the cyclops bonded one which has the imp-eyes too, but sometimes theh turned into a red concussion portal like it‚Äôs host, but all the other vemomized x-men had the venom eyes and some had the spider emblem.

214,Marvel,Theory: The MCU multiverse is a previous iteration of the comic book multiverse [Eternals Spoilers],"To start with some background information. The comics established early on that their have been previous iterations of the multiverse, usually in reference to the origin of Galactus. More recently Al Ewing has expanded upon this, showing that their have been seven previous iteration with the post secret war comics taking place in the eighth iteration.

Eternals starts with these words, ""In the beginning, before the Six Singularities and the dawn of creation, came the Celestials"". It is commonly believed that the big bang started from a singularity. With that in mind this could be a way of saying that there have been six such singularities and along with them six big bangs. That would imply that the MCU takes place in the sixth iteration of the multiverse, while the comics have taken place in the seventh and eighth iterations.

From a production standpoint this would give the MCU a lot more flexibility as it is not necessarily held by any of the rules set in the comics and doesn't have to worry about explaining the lack of a cross over between the two.",0.6,1.0,0.0,1.0,movies,2021-11-20 03:56:51,qxpdr7,t3

Well, recently, I was listening to Earth's Mightiest Heroes' theme song, ""Fight as One"", and suddenly, it got me thinking (don't know how and why lol), what if there was a crossover between the two shows, in the same vein as Turtles Forever (2009), or even Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans (2019) (except without any motion tweening involved, NO one liked that about TTG! vs TT!)?

Ya know? The Avengers of **Earth-8096** (EMH, and Wolverine and the X-Men, or ""Yostverse"") either fighting against, but eventually teams up with their counterparts from **Earth-12041** (Where Ultimate Spider-Man,  Avengers Assemble, Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. is set) to fight a major threat. How d'ya reckon the story would go, and how d'ya think the each of the Avengers from different continuities would interact with each other (^(without being too meta, like ""Your show sucks, ours was better"", of course, it's too easy, not to mention weak))? Any ideas? 

Bonus question: would you also bring in more versions of the Avengers from other Marvel universes (animated or otherwise), either for short cameo appearance like they did in Turtles Forever, or have them involved in a climax like they did in Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans?

For the latest movie we‚Äôll probably see this again, Tony has tussled with people like Thor and Whiplash (Ivan Vanko) who have used electricity, so it‚Äôll be interesting to see if Peter‚Äôs suit has a work around for that, or if the black and gold suit is meant for that since we see Peter fight electro in it.

243,Marvel,Why we NEED a Hawkeye game,"There could be so many things that could be great about this, the plot, the gameplay, costumes, villains and of course everything else. To start off, the plot, they could do alot but one of the more basic ones that I have come up with is that Baron Zemo has created the thunderbolts and with him and the thunderbolts they took out each of the avengers one by one until hawkeye is the last one left and after they kill his wife, kids and lucky (his dog) he decides to fight back and hunt down Zemo and the members of the thunderbolts. For costumes there a so many different options they could use, for basic costume you have normal hawkeye pretty much, for unlockable ones they could do old man hawkeye, ronin, bald hawkeye, casual wear hawkeye, like a hooded one, short hair, long hair, classic costume, a trick shot one, bullseye costume, a Barney Barton costume and like a swordsman costume. Villains, well like I said, Zemo (Halmut), the Thunderbolts and taskmaster. Now gameplay, it would obviously be a mix of melee with a kitana and range with a bow and arrow, you could get an upgrade tree to get new combos, abilities and weapon upgrades like better aim with bow, faster kitana swings and more. You could also have an option of 4 different arrows, so you would have obviously normal arrows + 4 other types, you could swap the type you want at any time to whatever type of arrow as long as you have it. You would be able to make awesome combos with this mechanic. Types of arrows you could get could be: spread arrows, bounce arrows, explosive, wave arrows (knock back), pierce arrows, acid, electric, homing, grapple and all other types of arrows, if you think this would be an awesome idea then let's confront marvel and make this happen",0.56,2.0,0.0,2.0,games,2021-11-18 02:57:52,qw7jgy,t3
244,Marvel,Theory about the new Spider-Man Trailer (Spoiler Warning for people who haven't seen the trailer yet.):,"So people are saying 'Sinister Six' however there are only Five foes of Spider-Man clearly there hence 'Sinister 5'- but then I started thinking. Because Mysterio is a famous enemy of Spider-Man and Otto had said '*Your Flying out into the Darkness, to fight Ghosts.*' and most of the enemies like Norman, Otto and Electro are there, my theory is that somewhere in the movie Quentin Beck (from Alternate Universe, ofc) swaps roles with Steven, explaining his odd behaviour. Side Note- Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness *could* take place just before this, and Strange, Loki and Wanda are stuck somewhere while Quentin steals and ruins Strange's name. And when Quentin/Strange says 'They're starting to come through and I can't stop them.' It could be the Spider-Men- Andrew and Toby with Real Strange (the other two probably go somewhere else) causing a Sixth and Final Villain for the Enemy Roster; Mysterio, with a climax battle for the movie. Also, the last theory in the trailer is that at 2:11 on the trailer, it looks like Harry's Blade Bombs and Outfit so- another ally! But it does seem a bit too ambitious.

It's my take on the trailer and it's only a theory. Also, if you haven't seen it- watch it! Thank you for taking this time to read!

249,Marvel,WandaVision question,"I know I'm a little late to the party, but I finally got around to watching WandaVision, and I am kinda confused. She always had powers, even before Hydra experimented on her? So what did the Mind Stone actually do? Just amplify them? And if she had powers before, does that mean that Pietro did too? I'm more confused than before I watched it.",0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,movies,2021-11-17 20:31:42,qvzc8q,t3
